# Blackjack_Game
Creared a Blackjack game in Python 3 using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) . The project simulates a console-based Blackjack game with a focus on modular design and interactive gameplay.

Key Features:

OOP Structure: Classes for Card, Deck, Player, and Dealer handle game components (e.g., card values, shuffling, hand management).
Game Logic: Implements standard Blackjack rulesâ€”hit, stand, bust detection, natural Blackjack, and push outcomes.
Betting System: Players wager chips, with balance updates based on wins/losses.
Interactive Interface: Console-based gameplay with user input for actions and clear display of hands and chips.
Error Handling: Validates inputs and manages edge cases (e.g., invalid bets).
Randomized Play: Uses random.shuffle() for varied gameplay.
Tech Used: Python 3, OOP principles (encapsulation, composition), random module.
How to Run: Clone the repo, run blackjack.py, and follow the prompts to play!

This project showcases my ability to design structured, engaging applications using Python and OOP.
